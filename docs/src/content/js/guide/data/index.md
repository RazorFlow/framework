RazorFlow Dashboard Framework is designed to be data source agnostic. This means that it's flexible enough to work with just about any data as long as your web server processes it before-hand. The dashboard API works primarily with native JavaScript types like Arrays and numbers.


Basics:

* {{ linkArticle ("lock_and_unlock") }}
* {{ linkArticle ("dashboard_first") }}
* {{ linkArticle ("prefetch_data") }}
